## Overview

Poppy is a lightweight chess engine written in Julia as part of a Bachelor's thesis project. Its primary focus is to provide a platform for easy experimentation and research in chess engine optimization. The engine is designed to be straightforward to understand while offering decent performance for analysis and testing purposes.

### Current Status

The engine is still in the **experimental phase and not yet ready for general use**. The current releases catalog evaluation function models which are being tested independently of their integration into the engineâ€™s search algorithm.

### Future Plans

I plan to work towards a more stable release in the future!
