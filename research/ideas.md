# Ideas

- Interpret a move as the state of the board after the move is made (i.e. one would then learn to rank states of the board - relative to eachother from a given state)

- Streamline/filter expert moves for blunders by some chess program, since the assumption that experts make only good moves doesnâ€™t hold. Advantage? Chess engines don't blunder due the the high search depth but evaluation is (probably) worse than that of an expaert chess player.
